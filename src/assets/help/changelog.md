- The backend communication layer has been restructured to be key-based rather than using direct function calls, improving handling and enabling more predictable state management.
- Added functionality to persist Query, Game, and Planning data so that users’ data state is maintained across browser sessions. Additionally, static data is now broadcasted across all open tabs in the same browser.

- Fixes an issue in HQ Upgrade Calculations were the starting level was wrongly part of the material list (by `skiedude`)

# 2025-08-22

- Fixes a bug where Planet Search material results were not sortable. This also identified a potential backend issue where searching for more than 2 materials returns results that actually don't hold the materials searched for. Currently the frontend limits to search for maximum of 2 resources until the API handling of the search query was investigated and potentially fixed.
- Selection dropdowns now close on any outside click and reset their search value on close
- Selection dropdowns now have keyboard navigation and value change
- Removes more unused naive-ui types and components from various views
- Fixes a bug on COGM calculation where the recipe runtime depended on the amount the recipe did run in a building instead of its regular runtime on current efficiency

- Populates cached data from list results, e.g. all empire plans, fetching multiple planets to avoid another backend call on accessing individual data. This is experimental, but could lead to faster loading times for plans as their data and planet is already populated from accessing the empire overview.
